## 💪 Motivation
> Other more known frameworks have way more examples showcasing how awesome they are. Sveltekit is the new kid on the block who deserves a lot more love! The idea came after stumbling upon [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas).

## ✔️ Goal

> The goal is to enrich the Sveltekit community with more examples. We all know how awesome Sveltekit is 💖 and we would like to make the switch to Sveltekit as easy as possible for newcomers.
